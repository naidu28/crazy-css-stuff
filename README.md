# crazy-css-stuff
Over the course of 90 days (and beyond), I'll be exploring CSS to learn more about the properties behind this powerful tool. Feel free to use any of my resources (as long as you credit me!).

Prospective timeline:

- Day 1 to 10: icons and graphics
- Day 11 to 15: shapes
- Day 16 to 30: simple animations (less than 5 individual frames)
- Day 31 to 45: interactive animations
- Day 46 to 50: 1 animated film
- Day 51 to 60: intro to SASS
- Day 61 to 70: animated portfolio
- Day 71 to 85: choose-your-own-adventure game
- Day 86 to 90: flesh out my favorite project
